# P2000T Programs

This repository contains a number of homebrew programs for the P2000T. All
programs are designed to be run directly of a cartridge. It is recommended
to use a ZIF-type cartridge as documented [here](https://www.philips-p2000t.nl/cartridges/zif-cartridge.html)
for transferring the code from your computer to the P2000T.
